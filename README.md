## Initial setup
Before doing anything in the project, run `npm i` to install this project's dependencies.

### Basic project hierarchy
This project is set up in two basic directories: 
- **prompts**: This is where the prompts for each assignment will live
- **src**: This is where the Javascript files you will be working with will live
- **test**: This is where the tests used to validate each assignment will live

### Testing that your code works
In order to validate that your code works, simply run `npm test` and ensure that all of the tests pass.
